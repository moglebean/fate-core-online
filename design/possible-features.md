# Possible Features

A collection of interesting high-level features to consider for future development.

## Feature List

1. **Smart Character Backup & Version Control** - Automatically save character versions before major changes, allowing players to rollback to previous versions or explore "alternate timeline" versions of their characters.

2. **Session Transcription & Story Archive** - Automatically transcribe and summarize sessions into a readable story format, building a persistent, searchable archive of campaign history organized by date, location, or themes.

3. **Collaborative World Building with Branching Scenarios** - Multiple users can build interconnected worlds with branching storylines; AI helps identify plot conflicts and suggests ways to reconcile different user contributions.

4. **Aspect Mining & Smart Recommendations** - AI analyzes player actions and dialogue to identify emerging themes, suggesting new aspects that reflect actual gameplay moments rather than just character creation.

5. **Music & Ambient Atmosphere Integration** - AI-curated music playlists and ambient sounds that adapt to the tone of scenes in real-time (tense, comedic, mysterious, etc.).

6. **Cross-Campaign NPC Database** - Create a shared library of NPCs across multiple campaigns; AI can "recognize" recurring NPCs and maintain continuity, or suggest when an NPC from one world could appear in another.

7. **Procedural Scenario Generator** - AI generates complete encounter scenarios (setting, NPCs, complications) based on campaign themes and difficulty settings; users can then customize or refine them.

8. **Consequence Tracking & Long-term Impact System** - Track consequences across sessions and automatically remind players of lingering effects; AI suggests how past decisions could impact future scenes.

9. **Real-time Collaboration Analytics** - Show which players are most engaged, track common decision patterns, and provide post-session metrics to help groups understand their play style.

10. **Mobile Companion App with Offline Support** - Lightweight mobile interface for checking character sheets, rolling dice, and managing FATE points during sessions; critical features work offline and sync when reconnected.
